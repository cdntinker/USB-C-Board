# Notes:
## U1 - STUSB4500 Standalone USB PD Sink Controller

(This chip and all of its support circuitry can be left off & then you can bridge JP1 and stuff R1 & R2 to treat the USB source as a standard 5V USB source.)

## U2 - R1501xxxxB Series LDO regulator

This chip is available in a wide range of output voltages.  Therefore, Vsec CAN be configured for anything from 3V to 18V.

In most configurations, the 3v3 version (R1501J033B) will be used...

| J3, J4    | PD output voltage              | controlled by U1                           |
| J5, J6    | Secondary output voltage       | controlled by U2                           |
| J7        | SPI connection                 | Not actually used here (except RESET line) |
| J9        | I2C connection                 |                                            |

| Jumper    | Purpose                       | Notes                                                |
| --------- |:-----------------------------:| -----------------------------------------------------|
| JP1       | Connect Vout directly to Vusb | really just for using the board without the PD parts |
| JP5       | For setting I2C address       |                                                      |

# TBD:

Need to find a spot for another LED...

Driven by VBUS_EN_SNK (pin 16) to indicate when Vout is enabled.

Not entirely certain that D7-D10 are useful...

## 2023/10/03
Removed ATTACH, POWER_OK2, POWER_OK3, & ALERT from J7

## 2023/10/04
An attempt at fixing J7... (See the notes below)

* Adding in J9
* Switching J7 to just SPI
