# The NerdMage Rabbit Stack  Project

**_This project Will likely ALWAYS be a WIP._**

Do keep in mind that, because this project is continuously evolving, it'd be a very good idea to verify that any board you have an interest in is complete enough to meet your needs BEFORE having it fabbed.

The basic concept is a USB-C PD-capable power input section for various projects.  The initial board design & format is based on an ongoing project where 34x34mm is the maximum available space for this portion of the design.

In fact, the first USB power board for that project was 35x26mm & a photo of it is [in the Pix folder here](Pix/The-Original.png).  You can see that it was a very minimal USB-C to 3v3 power supply.

Now...

Many rabbit-holes later...

Things may be getting a little out of hand...
